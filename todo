Incremental development plan:

  - 1st stage
    = develop the environment
      > ebasic physics
        ~ acceleration
        ~ impulse?
        ~ explosions
      > the actual physical environment
        ~ the walls
        ~ pickups
          # guns
            + rpg
            + laser
        ~ characters

  - 2nd stage
    = implementation of the guns
      > types
        machine gun
          small base damage
          large bullet store
          fire modes
            auto
            semi-auto
        rocket launcher
          large base danage
          small bullet store
          fire mode
            non-tracking projectile with a larger explosion
            tracking projectile with a smaller explosion
        laser
          medium base damage
          infinite ammo
          fire modes
            discharge mode where the laser fires like a regular gun and recharges its ammo store
            charge mode where the player charges the laser and it releases a burst of energy when fired
        vacuum
          no damage
          no bullets
          no speed
          infinite ammo
          fire modes
            suck
      > behaviors
      > effects on the respective enemies
    = modified enemy behavior
    = HUD to represent player equipment and supplies
      > score
  - 3rd stage
    = added lighting
    = textures
    = sounds
    = other ambiance creating effects

    TIME BASED SHIT!!!!!!
